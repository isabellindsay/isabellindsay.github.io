    <!-- <h1 id="bigheader">Hey!</h1> -->
    <p>I&#39;m Isabel, and I live in New York, NY (but was born in London). Next year I&#39;ll be starting at Middlebury College in VT. I started coding through my school&#39;s intro class and this past year I took AP CS. That&#39;s really been my only experience with CS, so I&#39;m really excited to be at Google this summer! Besides coding, I love traveling, biking, finding new restaurants to eat at with my friends, and chocolate (I&#39;ll pretty much eat anything if it&#39;s chocolate). When I can, I also watch a lot of netflix -- last night I finished season 3 of Orange is the New Black and I&#39;m stil really annoyed about the ending. I have one sister (who&#39;s 13 months younger than me) and a dog (an English Springer Spaniel named Lucy).
